# **System Design – Simple Overview**

## **What is System Design?**

System design is the process of planning how a large software system will work.
It is similar to creating a blueprint before building a house.
It involves deciding:

* What components the system will have
* How these components will communicate
* How the system will support many users
* How it will stay fast, safe, and reliable

## **Why Do We Need System Design?**

As applications grow (like Instagram, Swiggy, Zomato), they must:

* Handle millions of users
* Give quick responses
* Avoid crashes
* Allow easy updates

System design helps achieve all of this.

## **Simple Example**

For a Food Delivery App, you need to design:

* Login system
* Menu system
* Cart
* Payment
* Delivery tracking
* Notifications

System design explains how all these parts work together smoothly.

## **One-Line Definition**

**System Design is the process of planning and organizing the components, data flow, and architecture of a system so it becomes scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain.**
